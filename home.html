                    A few years ago, there was an attempt to encapsulate and treasure down in the burrows of the earth, all the available accrued knowledge of this globe, for future generations to explore and discover. Future generations may or may not be interested in such a time capsule from the past.
                    At Mahesh PU College, the academic fraternity is an active community of learners who pursue knowledge as an active and dynamic phenomenon with infinite and immense possibilities. We invest in the younger generations to instill in them the passion for knowledge and the seeds of research and learning. We strive to build a community of learners and teachers who believe that learning is not possible without teaching and teaching is not at all possible without learning.
